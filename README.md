This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to loose comparison (==) vs strict equality (===). The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code that uses loose comparison to check for null and undefined, leading to incorrect outputs. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code, addressing the bug using strict equality. This example highlights the importance of using strict equality in JavaScript for reliable comparisons and prevents unexpected behavior.
